        <h1>Research themes</h1>
        <p>At CDS we have three main research themes.</p>
        <h2>Responsible use of all health related data</h2>
        <p>We perform research, develop and implement federated FAIR data infrastructures. We put a lot of focus on </p>
        <h2>Learn AI applications from health data</h2>
        <p>We use artificial intelligence methods to learn from health and health related data. We apply a wide variety of machine 
            and deep learning algorithms. We use AI for two main goals:</p>
            <h3>Improve efficiency and/or quality of health care</h3>
            <h3>Support decisions to improve future health</h3>
        <h2>Apply AI for better health and healthcare</h2>
        <p>We introduce artificial intelligence applications to improve health of citizens and patients and improve health care.</p>
        <h2>Research projects</h2>
        <p>In projects we usually combine our research themes to meet the deliverables. We work in a variety of clinical settings including oncology, 
            cardiology, neurodegenerative diseases and irritable bowel disease and in both in care and prevention.
